# Network-Prediction-Using-Lstm-And-Rnn

This project focuses on predicting network traffic using deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The goal is to leverage the sequential nature of network traffic data to build accurate models capable of forecasting future network activity.

## Key Features
- Utilizes LSTM and RNN architectures for time series prediction.
- Predicts network traffic patterns based on historical data.
- Provides a foundation for understanding and implementing deep learning in network traffic analysis.
## Introduction

Network traffic prediction is crucial for optimizing network resource utilization, enhancing security, and improving overall performance. Traditional time series forecasting methods may struggle to capture the complex temporal dependencies present in network traffic data. This project employs advanced deep learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to address these challenges.

### Why LSTM and RNN?

LSTM and RNN architectures are well-suited for modeling sequential data with long-term dependencies. In the context of network traffic prediction, these models can effectively capture patterns, trends, and variations in network activity over time. By leveraging the memory and recurrent structures, LSTM and RNN provide a powerful framework for accurate time series forecasting.

### Goals

- Implement LSTM and RNN models for predicting network traffic patterns.
- Evaluate the performance of deep learning techniques in network traffic analysis.
- Provide a reusable and extensible codebase for network traffic prediction using deep learning.
